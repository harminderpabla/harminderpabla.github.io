## Project B (Affinity Designer)

Hello everyone, This is Harminder Singh. This is my last post in Project B in Directed studies. I worked on 
Affinity Designer.




## Overall Progress?

Before starting this project, my goal was to make a prototype related to dogs which would have desktop, tablet and
mobile versions. My Objective was to create at least 2 pages, one of them being the home page. As the time passed
by, I decided to make 3 pages namely home screen, contact us screen and news page. I gave special attention to 
color palette which was missing in the first 2 weeks.




## Lessons learned and unexpected challenges?

There are many lessons I learned from this project. The first one is to complete the work before due date so that
there is no rush at the time of submission. We should move out of the comfort zone and try all the tools and not
just be dependent on any specific tool.

I faced many challenges like
1. I got ill and so my work lagged behind that week. So if we have a head start, we would be ready for any health
or other issues.
2. I showed my project to classmates and they were not impressed with my color selection. So I decided to make some
changes in my project and I chose a different color palette. So I learned a lesson that we should always show our
work to others and receive feedback. This will always benefit us in the long run.



## Future Work

Affinity designer is a marvellous tool specially it's control over curves. To be specific, I would use it whenever
i need to play with shapes due to it's automatic snapping points.
