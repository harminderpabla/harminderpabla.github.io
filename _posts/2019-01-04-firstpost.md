# First Week Proposal for Directive Studies

# Project A (SKETCH)

Helo everyone,This is Harminder Singh. This is my first post in Directive studies. For my first project(Project A) I am working on Sketch. 
## The main reason for choosing sketch:
->It is less complex as compared to its counterparts like photoshop,figma.
->It is gaining popularity recently and has a bright scope in the future. So I want to have a good hold of it and and further sharpen my designing skills.
-> It is easy and simple to use.

## What Will I build and my topic:
I started by studying the history of sketch and how it came into existence. How it can be a replacement for the previous similar softwares. Then I watched some tutorials regarding sketch. So after careful consideration, I have decided to make a design prototype. It will have atleast 5 artboards and can go to maximum of 8. The topic I have decided to work upon is bakery shop. Obviously it will have a main page. It will have icons and i will try to insert symbols also.

## List of deliverables and tasks to be completed
To be pretty frank, I am not 100% sure what my finished task would look like. I have a rough idea which I have already discussed above and while I work on it. I may produce slightly different deliverable but the basic idea would be the same.
