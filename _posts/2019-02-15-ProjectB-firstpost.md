# [First Week Proposal for Directive Studies (Project B)]({% post_url 2019-02-15-ProjectB-firstpost %})

## Project B (Affinity Designer)

Helo everyone, This is Harminder Singh. This is my first post in Project B in Directed studies. I would be working on Affinity Designer


## The main reason for choosing affinity designer:

-> I wanted to choose a topic which none of my classmates have ever heard of.
-> It is easy and simple to use.
-> I want to have a strong hold of designing tools. I haven't used it before and so it would be a new experience for me. That makes 
this project really exciting for me.



## What Will I build and my topic:

 I have watched some youtube videos explaining what affinity designer is and how it can be used in designing. So after careful consideration,
 I have decided to make a design prototype. For this project I am focusing on making a mockup which will have a desktop as well as mobile
 version. I would be making a dog website which would promote dog adoption. I love animals and dogs are my favourites. So I would make a
 design which would encourage people to use this website and help many dogs which need owners. 



## List of deliverables and tasks to be completed

This week I would watch lynda tutorials and try to get deeper insight into this designing tool. I would start the desktop as well as
mobile version of the home page.
