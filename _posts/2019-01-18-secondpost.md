# [Second Week Proposal for Directive Studies]({% post_url 2019-01-04-secondpost %})

# Project A (SKETCH)

 Hi all, This is Harminder Singh. This is my second post in Directive studies. To remind you all, I am
 working on Sketch.


## What did I accomplish this week:
 I worked on the home page in this week. I have made the header of the page which includes status bar,
 logo, add to card feature, menu bar and and a search bar. I also worked on the main part of the home 
 page whichI tried including a slider. I haven't touched the footer part

## Which roadblocks did I encountered.
 The main problem that occured was the usage of slider. I tried inserting a slider with 4 differenet images 
 but I experienced some problems. Due to this I was unable to complete the main page this week.
 
## Plans for the next week
 I will complete the main page and make at least 2 other artboards like Contact Us and About Us page.
