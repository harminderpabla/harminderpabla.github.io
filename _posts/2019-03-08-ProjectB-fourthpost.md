## Project B (Affinity Designer)

Hello everyone, This is Harminder Singh. This is my fourth or second last post in Project B in Directed studies. I am
working on Affinity Designer.




## What did I accomplish this week? 

This week I made a contact us page for desktop, tablet as well as the mobile version. I also updated the home page as I
made some changes in the color palette.




## Which roadblocks did you encounter?

1. This week I fell ill and this made a serious impact on my project. I was unable to do significant work this week. 
2. Earlier I was using trial version of Affinity. Unfortunately trial version expired this week. I tried to find a crack or student version which would save me some money but was unable to do it. The only option left with me was to purchase it.
3. I showed my project to classmates and they were not impressed with my color selection. So I decided to make some changes in my project and I chose a different color palette.




## What is my plan for next week?

I am having my presentation next week. So I will complete my prototype till Tuesday and then work on my presentation.
