# Project A (SKETCH)

 Hello everyone, This is my second last post in Directed studies. I am near to the 
 completion of the project


## What did I accomplish this week:
 I made a new artboard called News & Stories which was later renamed to News. I worked on
 the footer of the artboard. I inserted some logos into the project. I tried different 
 ways to fit the logos but had to settle with inserting logos as images. I worked with 
 various color palletes and inserted some styling in my artboards.

## Which roadblocks did I encountered.
 I faced some problems linking my artboards. I was stuck for some time but after watching
 some youtube videos all my doubts regarding prototyping were solved.
 
## Plans for the next week
 I will complete my project this week and also make the tutorial for this project where I 
 will give a step by step guide to make this project
