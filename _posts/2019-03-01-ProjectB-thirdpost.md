# [Third Week Proposal for Directive Studies (Project B)]({% post_url 2019-03-01-ProjectB-thirdpost %})

## Project B (Affinity Designer)

Helo everyone, This is Harminder Singh. This is my third post in Project B in Directed studies. I am working
on Affinity Designer




## What did I accomplish this week? 

This week I made a home page for desktop, tablet as well as the mobile verion. 




## Which roadblocks did you encounter?

Every time when I got stuck even on little things , Google and youtube came to my rescue. I was worried about the
fact that affinity is a new tool and whether I would be able to cope up with it. But things seem to be going
at par right now.




## What is my plan for next week?

In the next week I will make the desktop, tablet and mobile version of the contact us page. If I get time, then I 
will start working on the other pages like about us etc.
