# [Tutorial for Directed Studies]({% post_url 2019-02-08-tutorial %})


Hello everyone, I am Harminder Singh. Currently I am enrolled in third semester in Web & Mobile App (Designer). I was required to choose a topic and work on a mini project for my Directed Studies course . The deliverables included creation of a small, simple prototype as well as a step by step tutorial for recreating the prototype.

## The main reasons for choosing sketch were:

-> It is easy and simple to use.
->It is less complex as compared to its counterparts like photoshop, figma.
->It is gaining popularity recently and has a bright scope in the future. So I want to have a good hold of it and further sharpen my designing skills.

## How I started:

I started by studying the history of sketch and how it came into existence. How it can be a replacement for the previous similar software. Then I watched some tutorials regarding sketch. So after careful consideration, I decided to make a design prototype (mobile version) of a bakery shop which would include different artboards.

## Step By Step Instructions:

Here’s what you need:
Latest version of sketch is advised to enjoy all the benfits. 30 days free trial version is available. The prerequisite knowledge of illustrator/photoshop would be useful. If a person has no knowledge of sketch or any other designing tool, this tutorial could  prove to be an asset for the aspiring designers.

1. First of all, take an artboard.  Insert->Artboard->iPhone XS
2. Insert the frame, status bar and search bar.
Insert->IOS UI Design->iPhone X->iPhone X Frame
Insert->IOS UI Design->iPhone X->Status Bar->Bar(Black or White)
Now let’s shift our focus to header. I inserted search bar on top. 
Insert->IOS UI Design->Bars->Search->Search Bar
3. Then I created a hamburger menu by inserting 3 horizontal lines in a square
Insert->Shape->Rectangle
Insert->Shape->Line
4. After the menu, I worked on making the name look attractive. Then I inserted an icon for add to cart feature where customers can view the items in their cart.
5. Then I Inserted images in my home page
Insert->Image->Choose from computer.
6. I have inserted an option to subscribe to the regular updates by entering the email address and clicking on subscribe. On subscribe button I have applied Gaussian blur to make it look different from rest of the page.
7. Now coming to the footer, I have a copyright symbol with my name and 3 social media icons. I downloaded the icons from icomoon.io site. For copyright symbol, I inserted a circle and put text in it
Insert->Shape->Oval(Shift +Drag the cursor for perfect circle)
Insert->Text
Insert->Image

In the 2nd artboard I have reduced the length of search bar and inserted a back icon in the header.

In the main area I have a rectangle with color filled in it. To fill color  
Create shape->Click Appearance on the right panel->Opacity
I have 4 options in the menu bar i.e. Our Items, bakery Hours, About Us and Contact Us. I have used an image behind each of them and reduced the opacity of the image.

In the 3rd artboard i.e. Bakery Hours I created a rectangle and filled color in it. Then I inserted a background image with very less opacity and inserted text. The same is the case with Contact Page artboard where I have created a basic form requiring 3 fields from the user. In the “Be in Touch” Button I have played with the text properties which can be found on the right panel of the window.

In the About Us page I have 2 options, one is philosophy and the other is team names. I created the arrow by using the combination of line and triangle. For both the buttons, I played with the fill option in the right panel. For “Our items” artboard there is a rounded rectangle for heading and 4 items are displayed with their name and price. In the news page I have a background image with text in front. Recent headlines related to bakery will display. Finally in the end comes the email subscription page, where A message will be shown after user successfully subscribes to the updates. 

## Layers

In sketch, layers panel appears on the left side. Working with layers is same as illustrator. Each object will be in it’s own layer. We can create group by selecting multiple items and pressing (command G).

## Prototype

Creating a prototype is simple in sketch. I selected the hamburger menu and clicked on prototype in the right panel. Then in the target option from the dropdown bar I selected menu bar.

So when we go to preview (third option from the right in top panel) we can click on hamburger menu and it will navigate to menu bar screen. Again if we click on back icon at left of the header it will go back to the home page. Similarly I have linked all the pages with each other using prototype feature of sketch.
