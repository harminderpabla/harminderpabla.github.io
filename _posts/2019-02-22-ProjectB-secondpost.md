## Project B (Affinity Designer)

Helo everyone, This is Harminder Singh. This is my second post in Project B in Directed studies. I am working on Affinity
Designer



## What did I accomplish this week? 

This week I started the desktop version of the home page. First, I created the layout and then inserted the content inside
the layout. So home page is almost 90% complete. It just needs some refinement.



## Which roadblocks did you encounter?

 Using a new tool always comes with a challenge. I had to google everytime I was stuck. For Example, I wanted to create
 buttons and also insert icons. So I had to watch lynda tutorials to get an ansere for myn queries.



## What is my plan for next week?

Next week I will complete the home page of mobile version and also imporove the desktop version. Then I will start 
working on the other pages like contact us etc.
