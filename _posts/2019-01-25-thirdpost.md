# Project A (SKETCH)

 Hello everyone, This is my third post in Directed studies. As you guys know, for my 
 first project(Project A) I am working on Sketch. 


## What did I accomplish this week:
 The first thing I did was completing the home page this week. I made 5 other artboards 
 which include Menu bar, Bakery Hours, Contact us, About us, Our items. The content has 
 been place in these artboards but it still needs to be imporoved.

## Which roadblocks did I encountered.
 I was facing trouble using the plugins. I installed some plugins but was unable to use to 
 my benefit. So I had to follow the basic approach of downloading the icons and dragging 
 them onto my project.
 
## Plans for the next week
 I will try to complete 90% of the work by next week so that I have enough time to write
 the tutorial for it. Also this week, I will shift my focus on styling my artboards.
