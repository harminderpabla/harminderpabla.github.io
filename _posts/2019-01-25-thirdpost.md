# Project A (SKETCH)

 Helo everyone, This is my third post in Directive studies. As you guys know, for my 
 first project(Project A) I am working on Sketch. 


## What did I accomplish this week:
 The first thing i did was completing the home page this week. I made 5 other artbaords
 which include menu bar,Bakery Hours, Contact us, About us, Our items

## Which roadblocks did I encountered.
 I was facing trouble using the plugins. I installed some plugins but was unable to use to my benefit. 
 
## Plans for the next week
 I will try to complete 90% of the work by next week so that I have enough time to write the tutorial 
 for it. I will focus on styling my artboards
